GS peerchat encryption/decryption algorithm 0.2a

INTRODUCTION
============
This algorithm is used by the games that implement the Gamespy IRC
protocol (IRC server peerchat.gamespy.com)
I have written this code because the first right of the users is to
know what really happens on their computers and the Gamespy IRC
protocol uses an encryption method to hide the exchanged data.


HOW TO USE
==========
gs_peerchat_ctx
---------------
this is the structure that contains all the needed variables and buffers.
You must assign it to both client and server.

gs_peerchat_init
----------------
needs 3 arguments:
- the gs_peerchat_ctx structure
- the challenge of the host which refers the structure
- the gamekey of the game

gs_peerchat
-----------
needs 3 arguments:
- ctx:  the gs_peerchat_ctx structure
- data: the buffer containing the data to encrypt/decrypt
- size: the size of the data

Watch the source code of the toolz I have released on my website for any
doubt about the usage of this function:
